To make a tribute page, you only need to know fundamental HTML concepts. First, you have to create a webpage. You can then add a picture of the person you are paying tribute to and add the person’s details, achievements, and so on. If you wish, you can also write a few words of respect for him/her. Using CSS for this project will be beneficial as it will let you include different styles and layouts.
